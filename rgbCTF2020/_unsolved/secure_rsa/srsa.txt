Secure RSA (SRSA) is a new, revolutionary way to encrypt your data that ensures the original message is unrecoverable by hackers. Top scientists from around the world have confirmed this mathematically irrefutable fact. 3 of our very own RGBSec members have developed this method, and we present it to you here. Granted, the method is very simple, and we aren't quite sure why nobody has thought of it before. Levying the power of uninjectivity, we set e to a small number. 0, in fact. Let's calculate the cipher now: (anything)^0 = 1. Since the message before encryption could have been any number in the world, the ciphertext is uncrackable by hackers.
